# ePortfolio #

The “ePortfolio” in Moodle provides a way to share your own content created
with H5P available with other students. The H5P content can be created directly
via the plugin or existing content types can be uploaded via a form. 
Currently, the content can be shared for viewing and grading. 
A teacher also has the option of making H5P content available as a 
“template”.

Also, a H5P content type has been developed for the ePortfolio-Plugin:

## Installing via uploaded ZIP file ##

1. Log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
   Plugins > Install plugins_.
2. Upload the ZIP file with the plugin code. You should only be prompted to add
   extra details if your plugin type is not automatically detected.
3. Check the plugin validation report and finish the installation.

## Installing manually ##

The plugin can be also installed by putting the contents of this directory to

    {your/moodle/dirroot}/local/eportfolio

Afterwards, log in to your Moodle site as an admin and go to _Site administration >
Notifications_ to complete the installation.

Alternatively, you can run

    $ php admin/cli/upgrade.php

to complete the installation from the command line.

### After installation ###
Set the capability "moodle/h5p:deploy" for role "user".  

*The default "user" role requires the capability "moodle/h5p:deploy".  
Without this capability user can't share H5P content and other participants cannot access the file.*

Set the default roles for "students" and "grading teacher" in the plugin settings.
